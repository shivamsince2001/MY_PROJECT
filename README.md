### SOME OF MY SOLVED QUESTIONS USING C++ PROGRAMMING

📌 **MY_PROJECT**  
This repository contains some of my C++ practice programs and mini projects.  
All programs are written to improve logic building and strengthen C++ programming skills.

## 🧠 Programs Included

- `palindrome.cpp` — Program to check whether the input number is a **palindrome**.
- `matrix_addition.cpp` – Program to add two matrices. It takes input for two 2D matrices, checks if their dimensions match, and prints their sum if addition is possible.
- `matrix_multiplication.cpp` – Program to multiply two matrices. It verifies that the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix before performing multiplication.
