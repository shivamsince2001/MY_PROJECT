# MY_PROJECT
This repository includes my C++ practice programs and small projects. It covers basic to advanced concepts like loops, functions, OOP, and Standard Template Library (STL). Useful for learning and revision.

### SOME OF MY SOLVED QUESTIONS USING C++ PROGRAMMING

📌 **MY_PROJECT**  
This repository contains some of my C++ practice programs and mini projects.  
All programs are written to improve logic building and strengthen C++ programming skills.

## 🧠 Programs Included

- `palindrome.cpp` — Program to check whether the input number is a **palindrome**.
  
- `matrix_addition.cpp` – Program to add two matrices. It takes input for two 2D matrices, checks if their dimensions match, and prints their sum if addition is possible.
  
- `matrix_multiplication.cpp` – Program to multiply two matrices. It verifies that the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix before performing multiplication.
  
- `simpleCalculator.cpp` - A menu-driven calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) using a `switch` statement. It includes input validation and handles division by zero.
  
- `digitToWord.cpp` - Takes an integer input, reverses it to preserve digit order, and prints each digit in words (e.g., 123 → one two three) using a `switch` statement. Demonstrates basic logic building and control structures.

- `prime_check.cpp` – Program to check whether a given number is a **prime number**. It takes an integer input and checks how many numbers divide it evenly. If the count is exactly two (1 and itself), it declares the number as prime.

- `armstrong_check.cpp` – Program to check whether the input number is an **Armstrong number** by summing the cubes of its digits and comparing it with the original number.

## ⚙️ How to Run

To compile and run any C++ program:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
./outputname
